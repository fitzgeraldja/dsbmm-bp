# dsbmm-bp
Model dynamic networks with metadata using dynamic SBMs, with parameters inferred through belief propagation.

To implement purely in Python, with relatively high performance and parallelisation through use of [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/).

Roadmap:
- [DONE] Simulation module
- [DONE] Base model class module
- [Consider later] Data loader module
- [DONE] Application module
- [DONE] Processor module
- [In progress] Subsequent model class modules
- [In progress] Tests
