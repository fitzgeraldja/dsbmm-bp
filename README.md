# dsbmm-bp
Model dynamic networks with metadata using dynamic SBMs, with parameters inferred through belief propagation.

To implement purely in Python, with relatively high performance and parallelisation through use of [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/).

Roadmap:
- Simulation module
- Base model class module
- Data loader and application module
- Processor module
- Subsequent model class modules
